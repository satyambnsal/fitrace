FitRace is a Web3 lifestyle application that integrates game and social elements, making everyday movement not just beneficial for health but also rewarding in the digital space.

At its core, FitRace creates a competitive and engaging environment where users can participate in races or challenges against other players. These races are fueled by the users' real-life physical activities, such as walking, running, or cycling, which are accurately tracked by the app using mobile device sensors.
